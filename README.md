# Overview

With this project I took on the challenge to learn how SQL and Python can work together in on system. There were a lot of things that I was able to learn for example the ability to created the table and have code take in the variables so that I didnt have to type it out for every input that I came across.

# Relational Database

What I wanted to do was creat a table that was abel to store board or card games that the tabel is the Primary Key, Name, Type, Cost, and whether I own it or not "own" then each row is each board game that I implemented

# Development Environment

I used Sqlite to make this easy to do the data base in Python and to have it be compatiable and so I could learn something new. With that I was able to make the table in VS Code.

# Future Work


* Fixing the spacing on the data base
* Getting a range of data for the cost
* FIxing the autoincrement
